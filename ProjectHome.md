This plugin is an extension of the BIRT JDBC ODA driver that allows a developer to override the execution of the JDBC Dataset by providing the BIRT engine a JDBC ResultSet via the Application Context. This plugin came about after numerous requests on the BIRT Exchange forums asking if there was a way to determine result set size before a report executes, or do some sort of data driven report generation. The only way to accomplish this is to generate a ResultSet prior to executing a BIRT report, as report elements are created during the Preperation phase, and data is populated during the Generation phase. In the past there were complex workarounds using data driven parameters to do this, but using this ODA, you can generate your result set using JDBC or using the helper functions provided.
